# Restaurant Software Automation
- This Restaurant Software Autmotion was created with Python to replace the pencil/paper method most restaurants use to take orders. This will give a higher chance of no human error and improve the restaurant efficiency. It accesses a GUI using python Tkinter. The host and busser will be able to view a CSV file of the tables avaliablitiy. 

- User access:
> Host: view/edit status of tables & properly assign wait staff to sections 

>Wait Staff: Input and Confirm order that will be sent to the kitchen

>Kitchen Staff: Receive the orders, press “Complete Order” button

>Busser: monitor/edit status of table.

>Manager: Review information and make administer changes as needed 

>Customer: NO CONTACT WITH THE SYSTEM
